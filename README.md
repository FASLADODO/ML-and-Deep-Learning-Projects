1. [Analytics Vidya JanthaHack NLP Hackathon](https://github.com/KanishkJain/ML-and-Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Sequence%20Models/Steam%20Reviews%20Classifier%20with%20BERT.ipynb) - 42nd (Private LB) out of 2500+ participants. Used pre-trained BERT (Bi-Directional Encoder Representation from Transformer) in Tensorflow as base and added classification head on top to predict sentiment of user reviers for Steam Games, achieving 90%+ accuracy.
2. [Analytics Vidya Jantahack Recommender Systems Hackathon](https://github.com/KanishkJain/ML-and-Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Sequence%20Models/Recommender%20System%20-%20FastAI%20Language%20Model%20(1).ipynb) - 25th (Private LB) out of 12000+ participants. Used AWD-LSTM, pre-trained on Wikipedia Corpus, using fast.ai library to recommend next 3 challenges user is most likely to take in an online learning platform, based on first 10 challenges for each user, achieving 0.23 Mean Average Precision (MAP)
